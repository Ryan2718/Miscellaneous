# Miscellaneous
Repository for small pieces of code - i.e. not whole projects

## Numerical
I think it's rather interesting to implement the same program in different programming languages. In this folder,
I have the same small numerical methods program writtern in five languages: C, Java, Common Lisp, Haskell, and Python. 
Notice the difference in the number of lines of code for each.

## Recurrences
In this folder, I have functions written in Haskell for four recurrence relations. 
Haskell seemed a natural choice for defining recursive formulae.
