# Miscellaneous
Repository for small pieces of code - i.e. not whole projects

## Numerical
I think it's rather interesting to implement the same program in different programming languages. In this folder,
I have the same small program writtern in five languages: C, Java, Common Lisp, Haskell, and Python. Notice the difference
in lines of code for each.
